            <p>Working on this project has taught me so much, especially about women’s reproductive health in the Philippines. Before researching the information about women’s reproductive health, I had very limited knowledge of it. I wasn’t even aware that there were specific laws that were passed related to it until we started our research. This experience has made me realize how crucial it is to provide further information regarding this topic, as it has been a long-standing concern. This has also made me reflect how many others out there might also be unaware of these rights and protections simply due to a lack of education or discussions around them or in the community.

                Through this project, I came to understand that reproductive health is not merely a medical or scientific topic—it is closely related to social, cultural, and political issues that affect women on a daily basis. It made me reflect on how reproductive health has long been a sensitive and often neglected subject in our society, despite its fundamental importance to overall well-being and quality of life. With this, I believe that this topic needs more attention, both in policy-making and in everyday conversations.
                
                As a woman myself, this project gave me a deeper appreciation for the complexity and uniqueness of the female body. It also emphasized how significant it is to prioritize women’s health—not only in the context of reproduction, but as an essential component of healthcare as a whole. Too often, women’s health issues are dismissed, misunderstood, or stigmatized, and this lack of attention can lead to serious consequences. I realized that improving education, awareness, and accessible healthcare in terms of reproductive health can empower women to make informed decisions, advocate for their rights, and take better care of themselves.
                
                Overall, this experience has encouraged me to become more proactive and engaged in conversations regarding women’s health, and it reinforced the need for compassion, respect, and equity in how we approach these topics. I hope that more people, especially young women, can have access to this kind of information early on so they can better understand their respective bodies, their rights, and the support systems accessible to them. In the end, this project did not just educate me but it inspired me to care more deeply and pay attention to an issue that affects so many lives, especially women.

            <p>Upon doing this final task, and being able to read through the struggles surrounding women’s reproductive health in the Philippines, I find it somewhat funny that there exists this irony of a system that simultaneously glorifies motherhood yet neglects the same women who sustain it. The statistics show the number of real lives being constrained by systemic failures. We have teenage mothers trapped in poverty, women risking death from unsafe abortions, and marginalized communities being denied basic healthcare.

                What unsettles me most is how deeply culture and policy intertwine to restrict women’s autonomy. The RH Law was a milestone, yet its promise remains unfulfilled, it is being stopped by political resistance and inadequate funding. There is so much hypocrisy in a nation that prides itself on familial values yet often fails the very individuals upholding those families. The criminalization of abortion, for example, isn’t just a legal issue but a moral contradiction because we will claim to protect life, yet we allow preventable deaths from unsafe procedures. Having this government heavily influenced by the wrong side of culture is terrifying.
                
                How can we expect young girls to make informed choices when discussions about their own bodies are always connotated with shame? We allowed taboos to override urgency and leave adolescents to navigate their own sexuality in the dark. The consequences of this are not just accidents but the direct results of our collective silence when we can just comfortably talk about these things.
                
                I think that we, as a country, must decide whether it values women as mere symbols of virtue or as full human beings deserving of autonomy and dignity and make sure that our actions coincide with the decision. Because ultimately, reproductive health is about agency and not just healthcare. When women control their bodies, they control their futures.

            <p>When making this project I felt more understanding and more considerate towards women’s reproductive health. As a male, I wouldn’t have that much of an understanding regarding women’s reproductive health, but doing this project taught me a lot about it, and how our government downplays it.

                Through building the website I was able to reflect on it and gain insight whilst working on the project. I was also able to gain insight from fellow group members and friends whom enlightened me on the subject. One of my friends told me that there are no laws that aid in women’s reproductive health in the workplace, and it's usually up to the employers to provide benefits such us paid leaves due to menstrual cycles or bathrooms that provide vending machines for their needs, and one would be lucky to even have these benefits. It goes to show how negligent not only our government but the workforce is towards women’s reproductive health.
                
                I think its admirable that women are building themselves a platform they can stand on in order to gain the benefits they need. Women are part of our society, and countless of times we’ve seen women stand up for their rights, and also build a better society for all. If women have a place in our society then it is best we also provide and respect their needs as we continue to foster strong willed women.

            <p>My experience in making this project with my group mates was fun and tiring at the same time because we made multiple efforts to do this even though our schedules didn’t match, we made time to formulate this project with our time and efforts. 

                Through forming this project, a lot of realizations struck me because of the chosen topic which was the Reproductive health of Women in the Philippines and I learned that a lot of sectors in the government tend to neglect the reason behind studying reproductive health. Sex education was not properly implemented in schools and universities and it was considered taboo because of negligence behind it which resulted in early pregnancy and the ignorance of numerous teenagers and young adults about protecting and taking care of their reproductive health. I also learned that reproductive health is not just about pregnancy and maternal care but also about empowering women to choose what is best for them thus was often neglected by the government just because these women lived in secluded areas and far places which hindered the medical assistance to get to their areas.
                
                Women should not be ashamed of what their bodies can and can’t do, it should not hinder their role as women in society and they should have their own choices and decisions made for the betterment of their lives because nobody should dictate how a woman should act to secure and care for their reproductive health. Gaining knowledge on sex education and reproductive health should be seen as a fundamental human right which supports the dignity of Filipino Women and it should not be seen as weakness from the perspective of other people.

            <p>Developing a website on the significance of women's reproductive health in the Philippines has been an arduous yet rewarding experience. Through the process of working on this project, I developed a heightened sensitivity to the specific cultural, social, and economic factors that shape reproductive health perception and response in our country. In a world where discussions of reproductive health are taboo, particularly in rural or conservative communities, I came to understand how important it is to shatter these barriers and create a space for education and support.

                In the Philippines, reproductive health services and information can be scarce, especially in rural areas. For many women, information about their own bodies, contraception, and sexual health rights is still scarce or misunderstood. Designing this website presented an opportunity for me to add value to an essential cause — giving women control of their reproductive lives. It was significant to ensure the website discussed not only clinical facts but also socio-cultural realities, such as religious ideologies and gender ideologies, which affect perceptions around reproductive health.
                
                The process of developing the website made me reflect on how much more needs to be done in terms of public awareness, especially regarding the Reproductive Health Law, which was enacted in 2012 but still faces resistance in some regions. I wanted to make sure that the site would be an accessible, credible, and safe place where women could get resources, learn about their rights, and learn about their health options, whether it's a matter of contraception, prenatal care, or the value of regular check-ups. One of the strongest lessons I learned during this project was the value of language and sensitivity when dealing with issues related to reproductive health. A good, respectful tone in the Filipino context is very important to ensure that women hear and are given support, instead of being criticized. I further understood that this kind of site can be an intermediary between the medical practitioners, teachers, and the most suffering women, to provide a point where they have access to truthful information and even local health service.

            <p>The website we created made me realize how important and urgent women’s reproductive health is, especially here in the Philippines. As we began to research, we observed how reproductive health services in the country remain limited and unequal in the country and how certain societal factors can influence these.

                Although there has been some improvement over the years, there is a long way to go for the country. For example, the Reproductive Health Law was passed years ago, but it has not been effectively implemented in various parts of the country, especially in rural areas. Many women, particularly in rural areas, continue to lack access to health services, birth control, and correct information. Health centers are sometimes inadequately funded or lack the manpower to fully function. As we conducted our research, we also observed how cultural and religious sectors have a massive influence on this matter. In most communities, issues such as birth control, menstruation, and sex education remain taboo. Because of this, most individuals end up being misinformed or too afraid to ask questions. For instance, some girls miss school during their periods because they lack sanitary products or feel shy. There are even instances where women resort to dangerous abortion practices due to fear or poor advice. These incidents occur because the subject is not openly discussed enough, and that results in serious consequences and even unplanned accidents.
                
                Misinformation is also a huge issue. Since some people still avoid talking about the topic, youths tend to seek advice from friends or social media, which are not always credible sources. This lack of proper education can lead to unplanned pregnancies, untreated infections, and even emotional trauma. Sex education, when taught right, can prevent these things, but many schools still don’t prioritize it. That’s why this issue needs more attention. The Philippines needs to catch up when it comes to supporting women’s reproductive health. 
                
                Aside from the research and content we found, developing the website itself was also an educational process. Each group member had a part to play, and our varied skills really assisted us in completing the project successfully. There were some who wrote content, others who worked on design and layout, and some who did organizing and editing. Communication and teamwork were essential. We were always required to keep each other updated, discuss ideas, and ensure we were all in agreement. It taught me how crucial teamwork is while doing something like this.
                
                This project taught me what is really going on for most women in our nation and reinforced the importance of awareness and education. I also realized just how powerful individuals can be when they unite together for a cause, which can be seen when our group created this website. I wish more people would keep discussing and taking action regarding this matter because women's health should never be neglected!

        <div class="reflect-content">
            <p>In being a part of creating this project, a thought process came upon me. It is that our country still has various taboos regarding sexual activities. Even discussing menstruation or family planning is often met with discomfort, as if these topics are shameful. While it may be true that it’s something scary for many and vulgar to some, reproduction will and always be present in every person living in this world. Yet, silence perpetuates harmful myths, like contraceptives causing infertility. With our selected topic, I initially felt overwhelmed by the grasp of this topic’s complexity as it branches out into many different social problems. Poverty, education gaps, and gender inequality are deeply tied to reproductive health, amplifying its challenges.

                I experienced an understanding that even in something basic like reproductive health, our country fails to properly organize a healthy system to address problems. Laws like the RH Law exist, but rural clinics still lack contraceptives, and sex education remains fragmented. So in my experience while researching for this project, I found shock, disbelief, and disappointment, especially with the statistics. Learning that 2,411 girls aged 10–14 gave birth in 2019—triple since 2000—left me questioning societal priorities. Sure, there are some efforts being made to shed light on this social issue, but we still observe no noticeable change or difference. Why? In my opinion, it is as simple as being poor, due to various reasons that branch out to more various reasons. Poverty traps families in cycles where unplanned pregnancies become inevitable, yet even wealthier communities face stigma and political resistance.
                
                Hence, I feel proud of the citizens and independent organizations that act upon social issues like this, and that is my insight. I had an interesting time with my group mates in producing this project. We debated framing the call to action, balancing idealism with practicality. We brainstormed, drafted until we finally implemented our final plans. Late-night collaborations taught me how collective effort turns awareness into advocacy. This project didn’t just educate me—it showed how small steps can spark change.
