            <span class="mini-title">Limited Access to Reproductive Healthcare</span><br>
            Access to reproductive healthcare in the Philippines remains inadequate and unequal, especially those women who belong to the marginalized and lower-income communities. 
            The implementation of the RA 10354, “The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Healthcare Act of 2012” was a significant step toward ensuring that women, most especially mothers have access to reproductive health services, such as family planning, maternal care, and education; however, its enactment did not fully succeed. According to Pasion (2024), the law continues to face numerous challenges, particularly in implementation due to inadequate funding and political resistance. 
            Such barriers make it difficult for healthcare providers to offer services such as prenatal and postnatal care, contraceptives, safe childbirth facilities, and regular gynecological check ups or follow ups. 
            Moreover, as the RH law provides modern contraceptives, access to these still remain limited (Smith, 2014).

            <span class="mini-title">High Maternal Mortality Rate & Unsafe Abortions</span><br>
            In the Philippines, abortion remains illegal under all circumstances. As a result, many women resort to unsafe procedures, which puts their health at risk and premature death of pregnant women and children. The Center of Reproductive Rights estimates that 610,00 Filipino women have induced abortions annually, with at least 1,000 of them dying due to the complications (Finer & Hussain, 2022). This greatly affects teenagers, victims of sexual assault or rape, and low-income women who can not afford private procedures or travel abroad for safer alternatives. With this, it is a significant problem for those women in the Philippines since many can not afford the appropriate and safer method so they are opting to do what is available to them.

            <span class="mini-title">High Teenage Pregnancy Rates & Unintended pregnancies</span><br>
            To this day, the Philippines continues to face increasing high rates of teenage pregnancy which is growing public health and social concern. The Senate Bill (SB) No. 1979, also known as the “Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy Act”, was introduced to educate young people concerning relationships, sex, and reproductive health. However, despite this legislative effort, teenage pregnancy remains a persistent issue and continues to increase each year (Dela Peña, 2025). The lack of a more comprehensive sex education in schools and communities is one of the main causes of this tendency. Many teenage girls are unaware of their reproductive rights and the consequences of unprotected sex which leads to early and unintentionally pregnancy. This further disrupts their education and deprives them from their opportunities in the future.

        <h2>Our Call to Action for Reproductive Health Reform</h2>
        <div class="cta-content">
            <div class="cta-point">
                <h3>Strengthen Implementation of Laws</h3>
                <p>The government must take stronger and more consistent action in implementing reproductive health care laws, ensuring that they are not just passed but are fully enforced and practiced by the people. It is essential to push for nationwide access to reproductive health services, especially in rural and marginalized communities as access to these services are more seen in urbanized cities.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cta-point">
                <h3>Comprehensive Education & Awareness</h3>
                <p>Promoting adolescent-friendly healthcare facilities and services, along with the implementation of comprehensive sex education not just in schools–but in home as well. It is equally important to encourage open conversations to break taboos surrounding menstruation, sexuality, and reproductive health in general. It is better to be informed than to go into the lion's den unarmed. With this, education and awareness minimizes risky behaviors driven by curiosity, misinformation, or impulsive decision making, such as early or unwanted pregnancies.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cta-point">
                <h3>Policy Reforms & Research</h3>
                <p>Urge for policy reforms that decriminalize abortion and prioritize women's health and autonomy. With unsafe abortions being one of the causes of high maternal mortality rate in the Philippines, reforming outdated laws is crucial to ensure that no woman is forced to risk her life for a medical need and that there is consent. In addition, promoting research and innovation focused on women's reproductive health needs should be enforced. Due to the lack of local, gender-specific data and studies hinder the development of effective health care programs and policies.</p>

                "Reproductive choice has to be straightened out. There will never be a woman of means without choice anymore. That just seems to me so obvious. The states that changed their abortion laws before Roe are not going to change back. So we have a policy that only affects poor women, and it can never be otherwise." - Ruth Bader Ginsburg
